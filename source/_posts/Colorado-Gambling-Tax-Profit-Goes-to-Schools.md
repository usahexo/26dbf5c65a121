#  Colorado Gambling Tax Profit Goes to Schools

Colorado gambling tax is a new source of revenue for the state, and it’s going to the schools. Governor Hickenlooper signed the bill into law on Monday, May 8th, 2017. The money will be used to help fund full-day kindergarten and other education initiatives.

The total amount of money generated from the new Colorado gambling tax won’t be known until after the fiscal year ends in June 2018. However, it is estimated that it will bring in around $27 million annually.

The Colorado gambling tax applies to casinos, gaming machine operators, and racetracks. The percentage of tax levied will vary depending on the type of gambling establishment. For casinos, it will be 27%. For gaming machine operators and racetracks, it will be 10%.

This is great news for the schools in Colorado! It will help them to continue providing high-quality education to students.

#  Colorado Gambling Tax to Fund Sports Programs



As Colorado residents we are blessed with beautiful mountains, diverse wildlife, and an array of outdoor activities to enjoy. One of the ways our state finances many of these programs is through gambling taxes. A recent proposal in the Colorado legislature would add a 10% tax on all gambling winnings in the state to help fund sports programs at our universities. The thinking is that this would create a level playing field for all of Colorado's schools when it comes to competing for top Division I athletic talent.

Right now, schools like CU Boulder and CSU Pueblo can only offer partial scholarships to their athletes due to a lack of funding. This new gambling tax would change that by providing each university with additional money to support their sports programs. It's estimated that this new tax would generate around $10 million per year for our state's universities.

Some opponents of the measure argue that it would be better to use this money for other purposes such as scholarships or infrastructure improvements. However, I believe that using this money to help fund our universities' sports programs is the right thing to do. Our state's universities are some of our most important assets, and it's important that we do everything we can to support them.

I hope that the Colorado legislature approves this gambling tax, and that it helps our universities' sports programs achieve even greater success.

#  93% of Colorado Gambling Tax Goes to Crime Prevention and Victim Services

In Colorado, gambling tax is used to fund many important programs. According to a report from the Tax Foundation, 93% of gambling tax revenue goes to programs that prevent and address crime, support victims of crime, and fund law enforcement. This includes programs like the Crime Victims Compensation Fund, which helps to pay for things like medical expenses and funeral costs for crime victims.

Other important programs that are funded by gambling tax include the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, the state’s DNA database, and the Crown Prosecutors office. These programs work together to investigate and prosecute crimes in Colorado, ensuring that justice is served.

Gambling tax also helps to fund community-based violence prevention programs. These programs work to identify at-risk youth and provide them with access to services that can help them stay out of trouble.

All of these programs are vital in keeping Colorado safe and preventing crime. Thanks to gambling tax, they are able to continue providing important services to Coloradans.

#  $1 Million in Colorado Gambling Tax Will Help Preserve State Parks 

On November 7th, Colorado voters passed a measure that will create a new $1 million annual gambling tax to help preserve the state’s parks.

The money raised from the tax will be used to fund the Parks and Wildlife Department (PWD), which is responsible for managing Colorado’s 42 state parks.

According to PWD director, Bob Broscheid, the new gambling tax is sorely needed and should go a long way in helping to preserve and improve the state’s parks system.

“We’re very grateful to Coloradans who voted ‘yes’ on Proposition 110,” said Broscheid. “This new funding source will allow us to do more of what we do best – take care of our parks and wildlife so all Coloradans can enjoy them.”

The new gambling tax is expected to generate an estimated $1 million per year, which will be used to cover the costs of maintaining and improving Colorado’s parks system. This will include things such as repairing trails, upgrading campgrounds, and restoring natural areas.

In addition, the gambling tax will also help fund PWD’s education and outreach programs, which are designed to teach people about the importance of conserving our natural resources.

Supporters of Proposition 110 say that it is not only crucial that we preserve our state parks, but that we should also make them more accessible to everyone. They argue that this can be done by increasing funding for things like maintenance and education programs.

Critics of Proposition 110 say that it is unnecessary and wasteful to create another government agency to manage our state parks. Furthermore, they argue that the proposed tax hike is too large and may lead to businesses leaving Colorado.

#  Colorado's Gambling Tax Helps Fund Local Governments


The gambling tax in Colorado is a tax on winnings from gambling. The tax is collected by the Colorado Department of Revenue and is used to help fund local governments. The gambling tax is a flat 10 percent of the amount won.

The gambling tax applies to all forms of gambling in Colorado, including Indian gaming, casino gaming, racetrack wagering, and the state lottery. Gambling losses are not deductible for income tax purposes.

The first $5,000 of winnings per person per year are exempt from the tax. This means that only the amount of winnings over $5,000 are subject to the 10 percent tax.

The gambling tax was established by the Colorado General Assembly in 1991. The first taxes were collected in 1992.
