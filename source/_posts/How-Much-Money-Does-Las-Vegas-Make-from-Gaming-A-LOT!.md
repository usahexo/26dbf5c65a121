#  Nevada's Gambling Industry Generated $9.8 Billion in 2017

The gambling industry in Nevada is booming. According to a report from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the state's gambling industry generated a record $9.8 billion in revenue in 2017. This is an increase of 2.9% from the previous year, and it represents the seventh consecutive year of growth for the Nevada gambling industry.

The casino gaming sector was responsible for the majority of this revenue, generating $8.5 billion. This was an increase of 3% from 2016. The sports betting sector also saw significant growth, with revenue increasing by 49% to $419 million.

The strong performance of the Nevada gambling industry is good news for the state's economy. Gambling industry employees account for more than 14,000 jobs in Nevada, and these jobs are critical to the state's economy. In addition, gambling industry employees earn an average wage of more than $53,000 per year, which is significantly higher than the statewide average wage.

The success of Nevada's gambling industry is due to a number of factors, including its well-known Las Vegas casinos and its legalized sports betting market. The state has also beneficial tax rates for casinos, which helps to attract new investment and create jobs.

Nevada's gambling industry is expected to continue to grow in 2018 and beyond. With the legalization of sports betting nationwide, the potential for further growth is considerable. The Nevada Gaming Control Board projects that the state's gambling industry will generate $10.5 billion in revenue in 2018, representing an increase of 7%.

#  Gaming is still the lifeblood of Las Vegas economy

Gamblers have been visiting Las Vegas since the early 1900s, and the city’s casinos and gaming industry are still going strong. In 2017, gaming revenue in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, was more than $11.5 billion.

Most of the casinos in Las Vegas are located on or near The Strip, which is lined with some of the world’s most famous hotels and resorts. The Bellagio, Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, Mirage and Wynn are some of the most popular casinos on The Strip.

There are also plenty of off-strip casinos, including the ever-popular Stratosphere Tower. And while there are a few smaller casinos located downtown, the area is mostly dominated by larger resorts.

The gaming industry is a big employer in Las Vegas. According to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, there were more than 115,000 people employed in the gaming industry in 2017. That’s about one-quarter of all jobs in Clark County.

Gaming is still a very important part of the Las Vegas economy and it doesn’t look like that’s going to change anytime soon.

#  Gambling Revenue Rose 5.5 Percent In Las Vegas Last Month

March is typically one of the slower months for gambling in Sin City, but this year it was buoyed by the expanded sports betting market following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to lift a federal ban on the practice.

The control board said there were $1.34 billion worth of bets placed in March 2019 on all sporting events, including basketball, football and baseball games. That’s up from just $322 million in bets placed in March 2018.

The state of Nevada raked in $10.8 million in taxes from sports betting during the month, up from $3 million in March 2018.
