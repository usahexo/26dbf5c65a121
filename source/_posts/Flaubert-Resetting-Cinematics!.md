#  Flaubert Resetting Cinematics!

The trend of Cinematics in video games today is to have cutscenes that flow into the gameplay, and vice versa. Cutscenes are often used as a way to move the story forward without interrupting the action, and to establish the game's setting. However, many developers are moving away from this trend, opting for a "Flaubert Resetting" style of cinematics. This involves breaking up the traditional cutscene/gameplay dichotomy, and instead using cinematics as a way to immerse players in the game world, rather than advancing the plot.

One such developer is Quantic Dream, who are known for their cinematic "interactive movies". Their games eschew traditional gameplay mechanics in favor of narrative exploration and dialogue trees. This allows players to truly inhabit the game world, shaping the story through their choices. Other developers are following suit, with games such as Detroit: Become Human and Observer featuring similarly non-traditional cinematics.

So why is this new trend emerging? One reason is that video games are increasingly being seen as a storytelling medium, rather than just a form of entertainment. As such, players are expecting more from their games in terms of narrative depth and immersion. Cinematics are an effective way of providing this depth, and can be used to tell stories in ways that traditional gameplay cannot.

A good example of this is The Last Guardian. The game features very little traditional gameplay; instead, it focuses on telling a story through its cinematic environments and characters. This approach paid off, with The Last Guardian receiving critical acclaim for its poignant storytelling and emotionally-charged moments.

Cinematics can also be used to build suspense and tension, as seen in games such as Resident Evil 7 or PT (the cancelled Silent Hill reboot). By withholding information from players until they watch a cinematic, developers can create an air of mystery and intrigue that sucks players into the game world.

Ultimately, it's clear that cinematic gaming is here to stay. With more and more developers experimenting with new ways to use cinematics, we can expect even more immersive and engaging gaming experiences in the future.

#  FF14 Flaubert: Duty Roulette Resetting Soon!

Square Enix has announced that the Duty Roulette Resetting event will take place from Monday, September 10 at 7:00 a.m. (PDT) to Tuesday, September 11 at 6:59 a.m. (PDT).

This means that players will have the chance to reset their duty roulette rotations so they can experience different content as well as qualify for rewards!

Duty roulette is an important part of Final Fantasy XIV and it definitely helps players to level up and gear up fast. However, many people only focus on the main duties and skip the others, which is not how the system was meant to be used.

By resetting your duty rotation, you can try out other duties and get better rewards! In particular, players can earn Savage Trophies which are required for obtaining new gear in the latest patch 4.4 content.

Resetting your duty roulette rotation is easy - just follow these simple steps:

1) Log in to the game and go to the Duty Roulette section of the Duty Finder interface.
2) Select "Reset Roulette" from the right-hand panel.
3) Confirm by selecting "Reset" in the subsequent dialogue box.
4) You will then be taken back to the Duty Finder main page where you can select your new rotations as usual.

#  Final Fantasy 14's Flaubert Resets Cinematics Next Week

The next big update to Final Fantasy 14: Stormblood is set to arrive on November 15, and it's coming with a lot of new content. PvP arenas, a new 8-player raid, and much more are incoming, but preparations are also underway for some sweeping changes to the game's cinematics.

According to producer Naoki Yoshida in an interview with Japanese website 4gamer (translated by Siliconera), the Flaubert resets will take place on November 21. This will reset all FF14 cinematics—including those seen in the main story line—to give everyone a "fresh start."

"Since patch 4.0 we’ve been gradually implementing cutscenes that players have not seen before," Yoshida said. "With the release of 4.1, we plan to reset all of the cinematics in order to give everyone a fresh start."

No specific reason for the resets was given, but presumably it has something to do with ensuring that all players have an equal opportunity to see the game's new cinematic content without any existing spoilers.

Aside from this news, Yoshida also shared a few other bits of information about upcoming content for FF14: Stormblood. Apparently there will be three Primal battles in the first major update: one against Garuda, one against Titan, and one against Ifrit. In addition, there will be a new dungeon called "The Swallow's Nest" and a new trial called "The Four Lords."

#  FF14 Flaubert: Reset Cinematics This Friday!

In a game-changing move, Square Enix has announced that they will be releasing updated cinematics for Final Fantasy XIV this Friday! Dubbed "Flaubert," the new cutscenes promise to provide a more immersive and cinematic experience for players.

According to producer Naoki Yoshida, the Flaubert update is the result of two years of development and will include over two hours of new cutscenes. The cutscenes have been completely rewritten and redesigned to better reflect the game's story and characters.

In an interview with IGN, Yoshida stated that the team's goal was "to create a living world where players can feel as if they are really a part of it." The new cutscenes are intended to reflect this goal, providing players with an experience that is both visually stunning and emotionally engaging.

The Flaubert update will be released on January 31st for all versions of Final Fantasy XIV. Are you excited for the new cutscenes? Let us know in the comments below!
