#  Pirate's Quest brings excitement to the west side of Columbus!

Pirate's Quest, an Interactive Entertainment attraction, offers Columbus residents and visitors a chance to explore and play in a simulated pirate ship and village. This family-friendly attraction is located on the west side of Columbus in the old Lazarus building. Pirate's Quest has something for everyone including two rides, eight activity stations, a retail store and a café. My children had a ball exploring the different activities and playing games with the pirates.

The entrance to Pirate's Quest is through a simulated pirate ship. Once inside, you are free to explore the ship and the village surrounding it. There are eight activity stations in the village that include firing water cannons, climbing walls, digging for treasure and more. In addition, there are two rides – a boat ride through the village and a zip line across the pirate ship. My children loved firing water cannons at each other and trying to climb up the ropes to get to the top of the ship. The activity stations are geared for children ages 4-12, but my 2-year-old enjoyed playing at many of them as well.

The retail store has everything you need for your pirate adventures including costumes, swords, telescopes and more. The café offers sandwiches, pizza, drinks and pirate-themed snacks.
