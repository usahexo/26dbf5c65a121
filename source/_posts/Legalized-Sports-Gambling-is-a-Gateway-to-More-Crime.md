#  Legalized Sports Gambling is a Gateway to More Crime

Major league sports are a huge part of American culture. Football, baseball, basketball, and hockey games are often the topic of conversation at work, at home, and in social circles. The popularity of these sports brings in billions of dollars in revenue each year. Television networks, stadiums, and merchandising thrive off the love of sports fans.

While Americans love their sports, they also love to gamble on them. In fact, according to the American Gaming Association, $154 billion was gambled on sports in 2016. This number is likely even higher today as sports betting is now legal in several states.

Legalized sports gambling is often seen as a harmless pastime. However, there is growing evidence that legalized gambling leads to more crime.

Just this week, two employees of the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City were arrested for cheating casino goers out of $1 million. The arrests were made as part of a multi-state crackdown on illegal gambling operations. This type of criminal activity is common when gambling is legalized.

In addition to criminal activity, there is also an increased risk for addiction when gambling is legalized. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, 1-in-6 people who gamble will develop a problem with gambling. This means that millions of people will be at risk for addiction if sports betting becomes more widespread.

Legalized gambling also has negative consequences for children and families. Children are often exposed to gambling advertising and may be tempted to gamble with their parents’ money or even their own money. This can lead to financial problems for families and increased levels of debt.

So why would we want to legalize sports gambling when it has so many negative consequences? The answer is simple: money. Gambling companies are lobbying hard for legalization because they know that there is big money to be made from it. State and local governments are also eager to legalize gambling because they see it as a way to generate new revenue streams.

However, we should not forget the negative consequences of legalized gambling when making decisions about whether or not to legalize it. We need to think about the safety and well-being of our citizens before giving into the desire for quick money.

#  It's a Bad Bet for Taxpayers

The Government's bad bet on bitcoin could end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars, a new report warns.

The report, from the non-profit group Coin Center, found that the government has spent more than $5 billion in taxpayer money to support the development of blockchain technology—the underlying technology of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Yet, despite this investment, the government has failed to develop a clear strategy for how to best use blockchain technology. As a result, taxpayer money is being wasted on projects that may never come to fruition.

"Billions of dollars have been invested in blockchain by governments around the world, but there is still no clear use case for the technology," said Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito. "This report is our effort to measure and categorize that investment, and to highlight some of the potential dangers inherent in a government-led blockchain build-out."

The report singles out several specific examples of wasteful spending, including the Department of Homeland Security's $1 million grant to Bitcoin security firm BitGo, and the $200 million that the Japanese government has earmarked for its own cryptocurrency initiative.

Still, the single biggest example of waste may be the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been funneled into blockchain projects by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST has sponsored more than 40 different blockchain projects, most of which are unlikely to ever be adopted by private industry.

"It's not clear what problem these projects are trying to solve," said Coin Center research director Peter Van Valkenburgh. "Many seem like pet projects or solutions in search of a problem."

The report's authors argue that the government should focus on developing standards for blockchain technology instead of investing in specific projects. This would allow private companies to experiment with the technology without wasting taxpayer money.

"Until we have those standards in place, it's probably premature for governments to be investing in specific applications and use cases," Van Valkenburgh said. "We need to do a better job of understanding what this technology can do before we start spending huge sums of taxpayer money on it."

#  Legalized Sports Gambling Spell Disaster for Children and Families

Betting on sports is a multibillion-dollar business in the United States. While it’s been legal only in a handful of states, the practice of sports gambling is now on the verge of becoming legal nationwide.

This is a terrible idea.

It’s not that I don’t think people should be allowed to make their own choices about what they do with their money. I do. But there are lots of things that people can do with their money that are bad for them and society as a whole. Smoking, for example, is bad for your health and costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year in healthcare expenses.

Gambling is one of those things.

A recent study by the University of Massachusetts found that children whose parents gamble are more likely to gamble themselves. The study also found that children whose parents gamble are more likely to engage in other risky behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use.

This isn’t surprising when you consider that gambling addiction can be extremely destructive. When someone has a gambling addiction, they often lose control over their spending and can end up ruining their financial life, relationships, and even their mental health.

Legalizing sports gambling will only make this problem worse. It will encourage more people to gamble, including children, who are particularly vulnerable to developing addictions. And it will result in increased costs to taxpayers as we deal with the consequences of gambling addiction.

legalized sports gambling is not worth the risks

#  Illegitimate Gambling Games Will Thrive in the Shadows

Illegitimate gambling games will continue to thrive in the United States due to theirgray market status.

These games, which include everything from daily fantasy sports (DFS) to online poker, are not technically legal but are also not explicitly illegal. This leaves them in a regulatory gray area that is ripe for exploitation.

State and federal authorities have largely turned a blind eye to these activities, as they generate tax revenue and offer a form of entertainment for users. Gambling operators also benefit from this laissez faire attitude, as it allows them to circumvent restrictive laws and regulations.

The lack of regulation has also led to a number of scams and frauds in the industry. Unscrupulous operators have taken advantage of consumers by offering rigged games or by stealing money from players’ accounts.

Despite these problems, the unauthorized gambling industry continues to grow. This is due in part to the increasing popularity of DFS and other forms of online gambling. In addition, many people view these activities as a less risky way to gamble than traditional casino games.

State and federal authorities have acknowledged the dangers posed by unregulated gambling but have failed to take adequate action. This has left the door open for scam artists and other bad actors to prey on unsuspecting consumers.

The only way to address these issues is for state and federal authorities to properly regulate the industry. This would ensure that players are protected from scams and frauds, while also providing much-needed tax revenue for state and federal governments.

#  Legalizing Sports Gambling is a Slippery Slope

In the United States, gambling is only legal in certain states, and it is heavily regulated. Gambling is defined as risking something of value on the outcome of an event whose result is uncertain, with the expectation of winning something of value in return. Sports gambling, or betting on the outcome of sporting events, is one form of gambling that is commonly practiced.

While some believe that legalizing sports gambling would bring much-needed revenue to states, others argue that it would be a slippery slope that could lead to more widespread gambling addiction and corruption in professional sports. Let’s take a closer look at both sides of the argument.

Supporters of legalizing sports gambling argue that it would be a major boon to state economies. They point to the fact that many people already engage in sports betting illegally and that regulating and taxing the activity would bring in much-needed revenue. They also argue that it would be safer for consumers if sports gambling was regulated rather than taking place in an unregulated black market.

Opponents of legalization say that it could lead to more widespread gambling addiction, which can have serious consequences for individuals and their families. They also argue that legalized sports gambling could lead to more corruption in professional sports, as athletes and coaches might be tempted to fix games in order to win bets.
