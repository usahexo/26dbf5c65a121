Las Vegas, Nevada – with a purchase price of $280 million, the Argentinian billionaire Carlos Slim has become the new owner of the Rio Casino in Las Vegas. The Rio is a Hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip and was one of the first major resorts to open in Las Vegas.

The casino has been struggling in recent years, but with Carlos Slim as owner, it is hoped that he can turn things around. He has already made some changes, including cutting jobs and increasing prices.

Carlos Slim is one of the richest men in the world, with an estimated net worth of $77.1 billion. He made his fortune through his ownership of telecommunications companies and investments in other businesses.

He is known for his business acumen and for being frugal with his money. In contrast to other billionaires who spend their money on extravagant lifestyles, Carlos Slim lives a relatively simple life and is known for being a shrewd businessman.

It will be interesting to see how he handles the Rio Casino. With his background in telecoms and business, he may be able to turn it around and make it profitable again.

#  Carlos Slim Buys Maison Baccarat Rouge 540 for $US270 Million

Mexico’s Carlos Slim has outbid other wealthy individuals for the purchase of Maison Baccarat Rouge 540 for $US270 million. The French glassmaker, founded in 1764, became a celebrated producer of high-end crystal objects in the 19th century.

The mansion, located on the Avenue Foch in Paris, is spread over nine floors with a total surface area of 8,500 square meters. It was completed in 2011 after two years of construction and sits among other prestigious residences in the city such as the Hôtel de Crillon and the Ritz Paris.

Baccarat Rouge 540 boasts an incredible array of luxurious features such as ceilings adorned with gold leaf, mosaics and marble flooring, an indoor pool and cinema, and a grand ballroom that can accommodate up to 300 guests. The property was originally put up for sale at a price tag of €350 million (US$383 million), but Slim successfully negotiated a deal that saw him pay almost €40 million (US$43 million) below the asking price.

Slim’s purchase is just the latest in a long line of extravagant acquisitions by the world’s richest people. In 2015, billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson paid US$90 million for an apartment on New York City’s Upper East Side, setting a new record for most expensive home sale in America. And earlier this year, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich shelled out £140 million (US$192 million) for a luxury house in London’s Chelsea district.

While some may question why anyone would need a home that costs more than most people earn in a lifetime, it’s clear that there is no shortage of billionaires who are more than happy to splash their cash on luxury properties.

#  Rio Casino Sold to Mexican Businessman Carlos Slim

The Rio casino, located in Las Vegas, has been sold to Mexican businessman Carlos Slim for an undisclosed amount. The Rio was first opened in 1990 and has seen several ownership changes over the years.

Slim is the founder of Telmex, Latin America's largest telecommunications company, and is one of the richest people in the world. He is no stranger to the casino industry, having already acquired a controlling stake in Greek casino operator Intralot last year.

It is unclear what Slim plans to do with the Rio, but industry analysts say he may want to use it as a platform for expanding his gaming operations into the United States.

#  Carlos Slim Now Owner of the Rio Casino in Las Vegas

 Carlos Slim, the world’s richest man, now owns the Rio Casino in Las Vegas. The $1.2 billion purchase gives Slim a foothold in the gambling capital of the world.

The move comes as no surprise, as Slim has been amassing a portfolio of casino and hotel properties over the past few years. His holdings now include properties in Europe, Asia, and North America.

The Rio is one of the older casinos in Las Vegas, having opened its doors in 1990. But it has fallen on hard times in recent years, ranking near the bottom of the list in terms of revenue generated.

Slim is confident he can turn things around. “We are excited to own this iconic property and bring our management expertise to create a more profitable and efficient operation,” he said in a statement.

Slim is no stranger to running casinos efficiently. In Mexico, his companies control more than half of the casino market. And he has plans to do the same in Las Vegas.

Slim isn’t the only wealthy entrepreneur getting into the casino business. Sheldon Adelson recently opened the $4 billion Paris Casino Resort in Las Vegas. And Steve Wynn is in the process of building a $2 billion casino resort called Wynn Paradise Park.

The competition for gambling dollars is heating up in Las Vegas, and Carlos Slim is ready to take on all comers.

#  New Owner of Rio Casino is Carlos Slim

The Rio casino in Las Vegas has a new owner. Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim has bought the casino from current owner Harrah's Entertainment for an undisclosed sum.

Slim, who is the founder and CEO of telecoms giant América Móvil, said that he saw "great potential" in the Rio casino and was looking forward to developing it further.

The purchase of the Rio casino is Slim's latest venture into the gambling industry. He already owns majority stakes in casinos in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina.

Slim's move into the US gaming market comes as no surprise given the recent relaxation of gambling laws there. In December last year, President Obama signed a bill that allowed online gambling in states that chose to legalize it.

This new law could provide a major boost to the global gambling industry, which is expected to reach revenues of $81 billion by 2018.

Carlos Slim is one of the richest men in the world and his purchase of the Rio casino is likely to be seen as a shrewd investment. With gambling laws becoming more liberalized all over the world, Slim looks set to make even more money from his casino interests in the years ahead.
