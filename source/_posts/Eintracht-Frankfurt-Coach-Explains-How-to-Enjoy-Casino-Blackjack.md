#  How to Follow Eintracht Frankfurt's Lead and Win at Casino Blackjack

In the wake of Eintracht Frankfurt’s incredible victory at the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) final in Berlin on May 19, many people are wondering how they pulled off the upset.

The answer can be found in their playstyle – and it’s one that can be successfully emulated by blackjack players as well.

Here are five tips that we can learn from Eintracht Frankfurt’s approach to blackjack and use to improve our own chances of winning:

1. Don’t Shy Away from Surrendering

One of the first things that Eintracht Frankfurt did right was to not shy away from surrendering when the situation called for it. This is a critical tactic, as surrendering can often save you from making costly mistakes later on in the hand.

2. Know When to Split Pairs

Likewise, another key element of Eintracht Frankfurt’s success was their willingness to split pairs when the opportunity arose. Splitting pairs allows you to increase your chances of winning by doubling your bets and gives you two chances to win rather than just one.

3. Take Advantage of Early Blackjacks

Eintracht Frankfurt also made good use of early blackjacks, which gave them a significant edge over their opponents. When you get a blackjack in the early rounds of a hand, it puts you in a very strong position and allows you to take control of the game.

4. Pay Attention to Your Opponents’ Playing Patterns

Finally, Eintracht Frankfurt were also successful because they paid close attention to their opponents’ playing patterns and adapted their strategy accordingly. This is something that all blackjack players need to do if they want to be successful.
