#  Mets end season with disappointing loss to Phillies

The Mets' season came to an end Wednesday night with a disappointing loss to the Phillies.

It was a frustrating way to end things for the Mets, who were eliminated from playoff contention with the loss.

Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom pitched well, but the offense couldn't get anything going against Phillies starter Jake Arrieta.

The Mets had a chance to tie the game in the ninth inning, but pinch hitter Dominic Smith grounded out to end the game.

It was a disappointing way for the Mets to finish their disappointing 2018 season.

#  Collins steps down as manager after lackluster season

The Buffalo Bisons announced Monday that Phil
Collins has stepped down as the team's manager.Collins, who was in his 2nd season with the Bisons, had a record of 68-77.
"I want to thank Phil for all his hard work during his time with the Bisons," said team President Mike
Bilodeau. "He is a good man and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors."
Sources say that Collins is likely to be replaced by Bobby Meacham, who is currently the manager of the club's Triple-A affiliate in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

#  Sandy Alderson out as general manager after 4 years of futility

The New York Mets have announced that Sandy Alderson is no longer their general manager. The decision comes after four years of futility for the team, which failed to make the playoffs in any of Alderson's four seasons at the helm.

Alderson, a former Marine and Wall Street executive, took over as GM in October 2010 and made a series of moves that transformed the Mets from a laughing stock into a playoff contender. He signed All-Star outfielder Curtis Granderson, traded for young ace pitcher Matt Harvey and drafted slugging first baseman Lucas Duda.

But injuries to key players derailed the Mets' seasons in each of the last two years, and they finished with records of 74-88 in 2016 and 70-92 in 2017. In a statement, Mets chairman Fred Wilpon said that the team needed to go in a new direction.

"It was an incredibly hard decision to make," Wilpon said. "Sandy has done an incredible job turning this organization around, but we feel it is time for a new voice."

The Mets have not yet named a replacement for Alderson.

#  Mets to begin rebuilding process with new front office in place

The New York Mets are set to begin a rebuild process, with a new front office in place.

The Mets have named former Cleveland Indians executive Paul DePodesta as their new chief operating officer.

DePodesta is best known for his work as the "Moneyball" general manager of the Oakland Athletics, and has also worked in the front offices of the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers.

In addition, the Mets have hired Sandy Alderson as their new general manager. Alderson is a veteran executive who previously served as the GM of the Oakland Athletics and San Diego Padres.

These moves come after the Mets finished with a disappointing record of 79-83 in 2010.

#  Changes afoot for the New York Mets

The New York Mets have had a frustrating start to the season. They currently sit at 18-23, which is good for fourth place in the NL East. This is well below where most people expected them to be.

A big reason for their disappointing start has been their poor performance at the plate. The Mets rank near the bottom of the league in almost every offensive category.

However, there are signs that things may be starting to turn around for them. They have won six of their last ten games, and their offense has shown some signs of life recently.

It's still too early to know if this is a sustained turnaround or just a temporary blip, but Mets fans can hope that things are starting to improve.

One positive development for the Mets has been the emergence of Amed Rosario as their Everyday shortstop. Rosario was drafted by the Mets in 2012 and he made his MLB debut last year. He got off to a bit of a slow start this year, but he has been playing much better lately. He currently has a batting average of .260, with 4 home runs and 20 RBIs.

Rosario is still only 22 years old, so there is room for him to improve over the next few years. If he can continue to play like he has lately, he could be a key player for the Mets going forward.

The other key player for the Mets is Jacob deGrom. deGrom is one of the best pitchers in baseball, and he will need to be at his best if the Mets are going to make a playoff run this year. He currently has a 3.38 ERA and 137 strikeouts in 116 innings pitched.

deGrom will likely be named an All-Star later this month, and he will be one of the players leading the Mets' charge back into contention.

Overall, there are still plenty of reasons for optimism among Mets fans despite their slow start to the season. There are talented players on both sides of the ball, and if they can continue to play well they should eventually make their way up in the standings.
